State Management Strategy
4. Provider Structure

serviceProvidersProvider - List of all providers (for client dashboard)
myServiceProviderProfileProvider - Current user's provider profile (when user is a provider)
serviceProvidersByTypeProvider - Filtered providers by category

5. API Client Methods

getServiceProviders() - All providers (client view)
getServiceProvidersByType(String type) - Filtered by category
getMyProviderProfile() - Current user's provider data
updateMyProviderProfile() - For provider self-management

Key Benefits of This Approach

Type Safety - Each provider type has specific fields
Polymorphism - Common operations work on base class
Extensibility - Easy to add new provider types
Clean Separation - Client dashboard vs provider self-management
Flexible Querying - Can filter by type, location, availability
